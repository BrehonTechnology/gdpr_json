# GDPR JSON

This is an effort to simply the gathering of user data that a web service (website or API) uses to ensure that they are transparent in an effort to complian with the GDPR.

## How it works:

A website or web service should publish a machine readable file called gdpr.json at the root of the website/service. 
The file needs to contain details of the cookies, services that it uses to process and store user data. 

Please see a sample gdpr.json
